    <h2>Explore the App</h2>

    <p>This is a simple chat application for demonstrating the usage of Server Sent Events together with an AngularJS single page application.<br/>
       You can select one of five chat rooms. You will find that Romeo and Juliet are having a conversation in room one. That way the app is a little more interesting to look at than the average chat example application.<br/><br/>

       This application has been originally written in Scala by <a href="https://github.com/matthiasn">Matthias Nehlsen</a>. This template is a port to Java. The Scala version can be found <a href="https://typesafe.com/activator/template/matthiasn-sse-chat-template">here</a>.
